        <h1>About Me</h1>As the saying goes a picture is worth a thousand words and with Mandala and Mithila artwork it often conveys deeper meaning and is a true reflection of our rich cultural heritage.
        Mithila Mandala art and what is represents – It is more than just an Art!
        </h5>
        <h5 class="w3-padding-32">
  
        <p class="w3-text-grey">
            I am Shilpi and Let me start how I started art journey. I have been drawing Mithila  flower patterns and round circle, pyramid since I was a young girl. When I was in school, I would doodle them on my notebooks and even today while I’m in a training class, at work or conference, I find myself doodling them.
            </p>
            <br>
        <p class="w3-text-grey">The paintings are believed to date back to time of the Ramayana, and they represent wide range of human emotions and experiences.
            The style of Mithila painting is very distinctive, with bold lines and bright colors.
            </p>
            <br>
        <p class="w3-text-grey">Mandala painting is a symbolic picture of the universe, the circle that represents wholeness, totality, infinity, timelessness, and unity. The circular nature of a wheel works as an artistic representation of a perfect universe.

        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="w3-text-grey">Where as the word Mandala generally represents the spiritual journey, starting from outside to the inner core, through layers. A circle is a great symbol to illustrate that life has no end and spirits never disappear, and everything is just part of nature, the world, and the universe.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="w3-text-grey">A painting of mandala is mainly created for a meditation purpose, being used to maintain the mind. When practicing Mandala art therapy, it allows one to take mind off  of negative things and decrease negativity in life. As they focus on coloring in the patterns of the form, they relax, their mind grows quiet, and they may enter a spiritual space. In modern day, mandalas have become a popular artifact for combatting stress and anxiety, countless therapeutic benefits, be it for fighting off anger, regaining focus and calming away stress.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="w3-text-grey">When looking at our everyday life, you will see that there are mandalas appears everywhere around us, from nature such as flowers, the sun, snowflakes, waterdrops, eyes, spider’s webs, kiwi fruit cut in half, cells of all living beings, atoms of everything on the planet to manmade items such as a clock, compass and so on.

        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="w3-text-grey"> In recent years there has been a revival of interest in this tradition, and I have created my own version of modern Mithila paintings and Mandala fusion.
            <strong>To sum it up - Mithila  and Mandala symbolises our heritage, ancestry, and rich and vibrant culture.</strong>
